This is all of the source code for a web scraper that fed restaurant health inspection data from the Multnomah County area into a database that drove a web site mapping the data. It has utilities for keeping up to date with the data set, and converting the data into formats friendly for map representation. I've since stopped scraping the site since someone else, I think Portland Mercury, came out with a similar tool, and I felt like I had completed it as a proof of concept to myself anyways. So I've put the code out here, it could technically be reused to scrape the data off of any health department web site that makes use of the same web application software. But I'll leave that as an exercise for anyone else interested.
